# CS 207 Project #

This project is basically the installation and calibration of the uspeech library on to the arduino in order to do simple commands such as turning off and on LEDs or turning a servo motor in a certain directions based on the commands spoken into the microphone. 

## Repository Contents ##

* **/src** - Contains the source used for the arduino (.ino, .cpp)
* **/builds** - Contains previous builds of the project 
* **/libraries** - Any and all libraries needed
* **/img** -All images used in the readme files
* **/LICENSE** - License file
* **/README.md** - Read me file

## Requirements and Materials ##

Dependencies:
* The uSpeech library http://arjo129.github.io/uSpeech/ - The project relies on said library

Bill of Materials:

* 1x AdaFruit Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX4466 with Adjustable Gain (note: any microphone with pre amp can suffice)
* 1X Red LED
* 1X Green LED
* 2x 220 ohm resistors
* 1x Arduino Uno
* 1x breadboard


## Build Instructions ##

Since most of the brunt work is in the code itself, the circuit is rather small in size

It should be noted however that the adafruit microphone has to be soldered on to connectors in order for it to be used.

## Firmware Installation ##

Firstly, the Uspeech Library must be installed (more on that here https://github.com/arjo129/uSpeech/wiki/Installation)
(Also if you are not using an Arduino compatible board then https://github.com/arjo129/uSpeech/wiki/Porting is also required)

Second, Calibration is required for different types of microphones. The process for which is outlined here https://github.com/arjo129/uSpeech/wiki/Before-you-start

(Note: There is also a nice youtube video on calibration by the creator of uspeech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BctPULWywYY&list=PL3w3hv5y0WElFP5O4oShEj51Ur0D6h_D4)

## Usage ##

For use by other people, the src folder contains two .ino files. One being for calibration and the other is the actual code itself. The ProjectCalibration.ino contains the specifications of my microphone (it easily changable to suit any microphone). The values in this file must be changed in order to suit the needs of your particular microphone

The project.ino contains the actual code to turn on the LEDs. This file is easier to use as it all that needs to be done is to compile and upload the file onto the Arduino. If calibration was done correctly, it should work smoothly.
