# CS 207 Project #

This project is basically the installation and calibration of the uspeech library on to the arduino in order to do simple commands such as turning off and on LEDs or turning a servo motor in a certain directions based on the commands spoken into the microphone. 

## Repository Contents ##

* **/src** - Contains the source used for the arduino (.ino, .cpp)
* **/builds** - Contains previous builds of the project 
* **/libraries** - Any and all libraries needed
* **/img** -All images used in the readme files
* **/LICENSE** - License file
* **/README.md** - Read me file

## Requirements and Materials ##

Dependencies:
* The uSpeech library http://arjo129.github.io/uSpeech/ - The project relies on said library

Bill of Materials:

* 1x AdaFruit Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX4466 with Adjustable Gain (note: any microphone with pre amp can suffice)
* 1X Red LED
* 1X Green LED
* 2x 220 ohm resistors
* 1x Arduino Uno
* 1x breadboard


## Build Instructions ##

Since most of the brunt work is in the code itself, the circuit is rather small in size

It should be noted however that the adafruit microphone has to be soldered on to connectors in order for it to be used.

## Firmware Installation ##

Firstly, the Uspeech Library must be installed (more on that here https://github.com/arjo129/uSpeech/wiki/Installation)
(Also if you are not using an Arduino compatible board then https://github.com/arjo129/uSpeech/wiki/Porting is also required)

## Usage ##

For use by other people, the src folder contains two .ino files. One for the user's microphone settings and the other is the calibration settings I used for my microphone. It is first necessary to download and install the uspeech library on to the Ardino IDE. Second, Calibration is required for the microphone. The process for which is outlined here https://github.com/arjo129/uSpeech/wiki/Before-you-start

(Note: There is also a nice youtube video on calibration by the creator of uspeech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BctPULWywYY&list=PL3w3hv5y0WElFP5O4oShEj51Ur0D6h_D4)

After you have obtained the settings for you microphone. It is as simple as inpting the values in the areas specified and If calibration was done correctly, The code should work as intended. All that is left to do is to compile and upload the program on to the Arduino
