# CS 207 Project #

This is project is basically the installation and calibration of the uspeech library on to the arduino in order to do simple commands such as turning off and one LEDs or Turning a servo motor in a certain directions based on the commands spoken into the microphone.

## Requirements and Materials ##

Dependencies:
* The uSpeech library http://arjo129.github.io/uSpeech/ - The project relies on said library

Bill of Materials:

* 1x AdaFruit Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX4466 with Adjustable Gain (note: any microphone with pre amp can suffice)
* 1X Red LED
* 1X Green LED
* 2x 220 ohm resistors
* 1x Arduino Uno
* 1x breadboard


## Build Instructions ##

First the Uspeech Library must be installed (more on that here https://github.com/arjo129/uSpeech/wiki/Installation)
(Also if you are not using an Arduino compatible board then https://github.com/arjo129/uSpeech/wiki/Porting is also required)

Since most of the brunt work is in the code itself the
